### 2.我最基本的生活原则 ###

Time is like a river that will take you forward into encounters with reality that will require you to make
decisions. You can’t stop the movement down this river, and you can’t avoid the encounters. You can only
approach these encounters in the best way possible.
That is what this part is all about.
Where I’m Coming From
Since we are all products of our genes and our environments and approach the world with biases, I think it is
relevant for me to tell you a bit of my background so that you can know where I’m coming from.
I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood on Long Island, the only son of a jazz musician and a stay-at-home
mom. I was a very ordinary kid, and a less-than-ordinary student. I liked playing with my friends—for example,
touch football in the street—and I didn’t like the school part of school, partly because I had, and still have, a bad
rote memory4
and partly because I couldn’t get excited about forcing myself to remember what others wanted me
to remember without understanding what all this work was going to get me. In order to be motivated, I needed to
work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to
figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.
One thing I wanted was spending money. So I had a newspaper route, I mowed lawns, I shoveled the snow off
driveways, I washed dishes in a restaurant, and, starting when I was 12 years old, I caddied.
It was the 1960s. At the time the stock market was booming and everyone was talking about it, especially the
people I caddied for. So I started to invest. The first stock I bought was a company called Northeast Airlines, and
the only reason I bought it was that it was the only company I had heard of that was trading for less than $5 per
share, so I could buy more shares, which I figured was a good thing. It went up a lot. It was about to go broke but
another company acquired it, so it tripled. I made money because I was lucky, though I didn’t see it that way
then. I figured that this game was easy. After all, with thousands of companies listed in the newspaper, how
difficult could it be to find at least one that would go up? By comparison to my other jobs, this way of making
money seemed much more fun, a lot easier, and much more lucrative. Of course, it didn’t take me long to lose
money in the markets and learn about how difficult it is to be right and the costs of being wrong.
So what I really wanted to do now was beat the market. I just had to figure out how to do it.
The pursuit of this goal taught me:
1) It isn’t easy for me to be confident that my opinions are right. In the markets, you can do a huge
   amount of work and still be wrong.
2) Bad opinions can be very costly. Most people come up with opinions and there’s no cost to them. Not so
   in the market. This is why I have learned to be cautious. No matter how hard I work, I really can’t be sure.
3) The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money, you
   have to be right when they’re wrong.
    
   So …
   ...1) I worked for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do. For that reason, I never felt
   that I had to do anything. All the work I ever did was just what I needed to do to get what I wanted.
   Since I always had the prerogative to strive for what I wanted, I never felt forced to do anything.
   ...2) I came up with the best independent opinions I could muster to get what I wanted. For
   example, when I wanted to make money in the markets, I knew that I had to learn about companies
   to assess the attractiveness of their stocks. At the time, Fortune magazine had a little tear-out
   coupon that you could mail in to get the annual reports of any companies on the Fortune 500, for
   free. So I ordered all the annual reports and worked my way through the most interesting ones and
   formed opinions5
   about which companies were exciting.
   ...3) I stress-tested my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I
   could find out where I was wrong.6
   I never cared much about others’ conclusions—only for the
   reasoning that led to these conclusions. That reasoning had to make sense to me. Through this
   process, I improved my chances of being right, and I learned a lot from a lot of great people.
   ...4) I remained wary about being overconfident, and I figured out how to effectively deal with my
   not knowing. I dealt with my not knowing by either continuing to gather information until I reached
   the point that I could be confident or by eliminating my exposure to the risks of not knowing.7
   ...5) I wrestled with my realities, reflected on the consequences of my decisions, and learned and
   improved from this process.
   By doing these things, I learned how important and how liberating it is to think for myself.
   In a nutshell, this is the whole approach that I believe will work best for you—the best summary of what I want
   the people who are working with me to do in order to accomplish great things. I want you to work for yourself,
   to come up with independent opinions, to stress-test them, to be wary about being overconfident, and to
   reflect on the consequences of your decisions and constantly improve.
   After I graduated from high school, I went to a local college that I barely got in to. I loved it, unlike high school,
   because I could learn about things that interested me; I studied because I enjoyed it, not because I had to.
   At that time the Beatles had made a trip to India to learn how to meditate, which triggered my interest, so I
   learned how to meditate. It helped me think more clearly and creatively, so I’m sure that enhanced my enjoyment
   of, and success at, learning.8
   Unlike in high school, in college I did very well.
   And of course I continued to trade markets. Around this time I became interested in trading commodities
   futures, though virtually nobody traded them back then. I was attracted to trading them just because they had
   low margin requirements so I figured I could make more money by being right (which I planned to be).
   By the time I graduated college, in 1971, I had been admitted to Harvard Business School, where I would go in
   the fall. That summer between college and HBS I clerked on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. This was
   the summer of the breakdown of the global monetary system (i.e., the Bretton Woods system). It was one of the
   most dramatic economic events ever and I was at the epicenter of it, so it thrilled me. It was a currency crisis that
   drove all market behaviors, so I delved into understanding the currency markets. The currency markets would be
   important to me for the rest of my life.

   That fall I went to Harvard Business School, which I was excited about because I felt that I had climbed to the
   top and would be with the best of the best. Despite these high expectations, the place was even better than I
   expected because the case study method allowed for an open-ended figuring things out and debating with others
   to get at the best answers, rather than memorizing facts. I loved the work-hard, play-hard environment.
   In the summer between my two years at HBS, I pursued my interest in trading commodities futures by convincing
   the Director of Commodities for Merrill Lynch to give me a job as his assistant. At the time, commodities trading
   was still an obscure thing to do.
   In the fall I went back to HBS, and in that academic year, 1972-73, trading commodities futures became a hot
   thing to do. That is because the monetary system’s breakdown that occurred in 1971 led to an inflationary surge
   that sent commodity prices higher. As a result of this, the first oil shock occurred in 1973. As inflation started to
   surge, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy to fight it, so stocks went down in the worst bear market
   since the Great Depression. So, commodities futures trading was hot and stock market investing was not.
   Naturally, brokerage houses that didn’t have commodities trading departments wanted them, and there was a
   shortage of people who knew anything about it. Virtually nobody in the commodities futures business had the
   type of Harvard Business School background that I had. So I was hired as Director of Commodities at a
   moderate-size brokerage and given an old salt who had lots of commodities brokerage experience to help me set
   up a commodities division. The bad stock market environment ended up taking this brokerage house down before
   we could get the commodities futures trading going. I went to a bigger, more successful brokerage, where I was
   in charge of its institutional/hedging business. But I didn’t fit into the organization well, so I was fired
   essentially for insubordination.
   So in 1975, after a quick two-year stint on Wall Street after school, I started Bridgewater. Soon after, I got
   married and began my family.
   Through this time and ‘til now I followed the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to beat
   the market, i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with
   the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stress-testing my opinions by
   having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being
   wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the
   results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.
   Since I started Bridgewater, I have gained a lot more experience that has taught me a lot more, mostly by making
   mistakes and learning from them. Most importantly:
   I learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life,
   and that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all my realities.
   I learned that finding out what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people
   think is bad—like mistakes and personal weaknesses—is good because I can then deal with these things
   so that they don’t stand in my way.
   I learned that there is nothing to fear from truth. While some truths can be scary—for example, finding
   out that you have a deadly disease—knowing them allows us to deal with them better. Being truthful,
   and letting others be completely truthful, allows me and others to fully explore our thoughts and
   exposes us to the feedback that is essential for our learning.
   I learned that being truthful was an extension of my freedom to be me. I believe that people who are one
   way on the inside and believe that they need to be another way outside to please others become
   conflicted and often lose touch with what they really think and feel. It’s difficult for them to be happy
   and almost impossible for them to be at their best. I know that’s true for me.
   I learned that I want the people I deal with to say what they really believe and to listen to what others
   say in reply, in order to find out what is true. I learned that one of the greatest sources of problems in
   our society arises from people having loads of wrong theories in their heads—often theories that are

   critical of others—that they won’t test by speaking to the relevant people about them. Instead, they talk
   behind people’s backs, which leads to pervasive misinformation. I learned to hate this because I could
   see that making judgments about people so that they are tried and sentenced in your head, without
   asking them for their perspective, is both unethical and unproductive.9
   So I learned to love real integrity
   (saying the same things as one believes)10 and to despise the lack of it.11
   I learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things
   that differentiates people is their approach to handling them. I learned that there is an incredible beauty
   to mistakes, because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle and a gem that I could get if I solved it, i.e., a
   principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future. I learned that each mistake was probably
   a reflection of something that I was (or others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was,
   I could learn how to be more effective. I learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and
   weaknesses was the training that strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling
   that made me and those around me appreciate our successes.12
   I learned that the popular picture of success—which is like a glossy photo of an ideal man or woman
   out of a Ralph Lauren catalog, with a bio attached listing all of their accomplishments like going to the
   best prep schools and an Ivy League college, and getting all the answers right on tests—is an inaccurate
   picture of the typical successful person. I met a number of great people and learned that none of them
   were born great—they all made lots of mistakes and had lots weaknesses—and that great people become
   great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and figuring out how to get around them. So I
   learned that the people who make the most of the process of encountering reality, especially the
   painful obstacles, learn the most and get what they want faster than people who do not. I learned that
   they are the great ones—the ones I wanted to have around me.
   In short, I learned that being totally truthful, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, led to a rapid
   rate of improvement and movement toward what I wanted.
   While this approach worked great for me, I found it more opposite than similar to most others’ approaches,
   which has produced communications challenges.
   Specifically, I found that:
   While most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that
   figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path.13
   While most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that
   having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning.14
   While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things
   because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.
   
   While most others seem to believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that
   it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting
   them stand in your way.
   While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.15
   One of the advantages of my being over 60 years old—and there aren’t many—is that we can look back on my
   story to see how I came by these beliefs and how they have worked for me. It is now more than 35 years after I
   started Bridgewater and about the same number of years since I got married and began my family. I am obviously
   not your Ralph Lauren poster child for success, yet I’ve had a lot of successes, though they’re probably not what
   you’re thinking.
   Yes, I started Bridgewater from scratch, and now it’s a uniquely successful company and I am on the Forbes 400
   list. But these results were never my goals—they were just residual outcomes—so my getting them can’t be
   indications of my success. And, quite frankly, I never found them very rewarding.16
   What I wanted was to have an interesting, diverse life filled with lots of learning—and especially meaningful
   work and meaningful relationships. I feel that I have gotten these in abundance and I am happy. And I feel that I
   got what I wanted by following the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to beat the market,
   i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best indepen�dent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stress-testing my opinions by having the smartest
   people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence,
   and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting
   on what I did to produce them so that I could improve. I believe that by following this approach I moved faster to
   my goals by learning a lot more than if I hadn’t followed it.
   Here are the most important principles that I learned along the way.
   My Most Fundamental Principles
   In pursuing my goals I encountered realities, often in the form of problems, and I had to make decisions. I found
   that if I accepted the realities rather than wished that they didn’t exist and if I learned how to work with them
   rather than fight them, I could figure out how to get to my goals. It might take repeated tries, and seeking the
   input of others, but I could eventually get there. As a result, I have become someone who believes that we need to
   deeply understand, accept, and work with reality in order to get what we want out of life. Whether it is knowing
   how people really think and behave when dealing with them, or how things really work on a material level—so
   that if we do X then Y will happen—understanding reality gives us the power to get what we want out of life, or
   at least to dramatically improve our odds of success. In other words, I have become a “hyperrealist.”
   When I say I’m a hyperrealist, people sometimes think I don’t believe in making dreams happen. This couldn’t be
   further from the truth. In fact, I believe that without pursuing dreams, life is mundane. I am just saying that I
   believe hyperrealism is the best way to choose and achieve one’s dreams. The people who really change the
   world are the ones who see what’s possible and figure out how to make that happen. I believe that dreamers who
   simply imagine things that would be nice but are not possible don’t sufficiently appreciate the laws of the
   universe to understand the true implications of their desires, much less how to achieve them.
   Let me explain what I mean.
   
   wouldn’t be able to know how important it really is for me. I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the
   basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life—meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures—are not, past a certain point,
   materially improved upon by having a lot of money. For me, money has always been very important to the point that I could have these basics covered and never very important beyond that. That doesn’t mean that I don’t think
   that having more is good—it’s just that I don’t think it’s a big deal. So, while I spend money on some very expensive things that cost multiples relative to the more fundamental things, these expensive things have never brought
   me much enjoyment relative to the much cheaper, more fundamental things. They were just like cherries on the cake. For my tastes, if I had to choose, I’d rather be a backpacker who is exploring the world with little money than
   a big income earner who is in a job I don’t enjoy. (Though being in a job that provides me with what I want is best of all, for me). Also, from having come from having next-to-nothing to having a lot, I have developed a strong
   belief that, all things being equal, offering equal opportunity is fundamental to being good, while handing out money to capable people that weakens their need to get stronger and contribute to society is bad.

   I believe there are an infinite number of laws of the universe and that all progress or dreams achieved come from
   operating in a way that’s consistent with them. These laws and the principles of how to operate in harmony with
   them have always existed. We were given these laws by nature. Man didn’t and can’t make them up. He can only
   hope to understand them and use them to get what he wants. For example, the ability to fly or to send cellular
   phone signals imperceptibly and instantaneously around the world or any other new and beneficial developments
   resulted from understanding and using previously existing laws of the universe. These inventions did not come
   from people who were not well-grounded in reality.17 The same is true for economic, political, and social systems
   that work. Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they
   want. The converse is also true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For
   example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their
   idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.
   This brings me to my most fundamental principle:
   Truth
   —more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality—
   is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.
   While I spend the most time studying how the realities that affect me most work—i.e., those that drive the
   markets and the people I deal with—I also love to study nature to try to figure out how it works because, to me,
   nature is both beautiful and practical.
   Its perfection and brilliance staggers me. When I think about all the flying machines, swimming machines, and
   billions of other systems that nature created, from the microscopic level to the cosmic level, and how they
   interact with one another to make a workable whole that evolves through time and through multi-dimensions,
   my breath is taken away. It seems to me that, in relation to nature, man has the intelligence of a mold growing on
   an apple—man can’t even make a mosquito, let alone scratch the surface of understanding the universe.
   Though how nature works is way beyond man’s ability to comprehend, I have found that observing how nature
   works offers innumerable lessons that can help us understand the realities that affect us. That is because, though
   man is unique, he is part of nature and subject to most of the same laws of nature that affect other species.
   For example, I have found that by looking at what is rewarded and punished, and why, universally—i.e., in nature
   as well as in humanity—I have been able to learn more about what is “good” and “bad” than by listening to most
   people’s views about good and bad. It seems to me that what most people call “good” and “bad” typically reflects
   their particular group’s preferences: the Taliban’s definitions are different from Americans’, which are different
   from others’—and within each group there are differences and they are intended to paint a picture of the world
   the way they’d like it to be rather than the way it really is. So there are many different takes on what is good and
   bad that each group uses to call others “bad” and themselves “good,” some of which are practical and others of
   which are impractical. Yet all of them, and everything else, are subject to the same laws of nature–i.e., I believe
   that we all get rewarded and punished according to whether we operate in harmony or in conflict with nature’s
   laws, and that all societies will succeed or fail in the degrees that they operate consistently with these laws.
   This perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating consistently
   with the natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws. In other words, for something
   to be “good” it must be grounded in reality. And if something is in conflict with reality—for example, if morality
   is in conflict with reality—it is “bad,” i.e., it will not produce good outcomes.
   In other words, I believe that understanding what is good is obtained by looking at the way the world works and
   figuring out how to operate in harmony with it to help it (and yourself) evolve. But it is not obvious, and it is
   sometimes difficult to accept.
   

   For example, when a pack of hyenas takes down a young wildebeest, is this good or bad? At face value, this seems
   terrible; the poor wildebeest suffers and dies. Some people might even say that the hyenas are evil. Yet this type
   of apparently evil behavior exists throughout nature through all species and was created by nature, which is
   much smarter than I am, so before I jump to pronouncing it evil, I need to try to see if it might be good. When I
   think about it, like death itself, this behavior is integral to the enormously complex and efficient system that has
   worked for as long as there has been life. And when I think of the second- and third-order consequences, it
   becomes obvious that this behavior is good for both the hyenas, who are operating in their self-interest, and in
   the interests of the greater system, which includes the wildebeest, because killing and eating the wildebeest
   fosters evolution, i.e., the natural process of improvement. In fact, if I changed anything about the way that
   dynamic works, the overall outcome would be worse.
   I believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest single
   force in the universe, and that it is good.18 It affects the changes of everything from all species to the entire
   solar system. It is good because evolution is the process of adaptation that leads to improvement. So, based on
   how I observe both nature and humanity working, I believe that what is bad and most punished are those things
   that don’t work because they are at odds with the laws of the universe and they impede evolution.
   I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive driving force.
   Enjoying your job, a craft, or your favorite sport comes from the innate satisfaction of getting better. Though
   most people typically think that they are striving to get things (e.g., toys, better houses, money, status, etc.) that
   will make them happy, that is not usually the case. Instead, when we get the things we are striving for, we rarely
   remain satisfied.19 It is natural for us to seek other things or to seek to make the things we have better. In the
   process of this seeking, we continue to evolve and we contribute to the evolution of all that we have contact with.
   The things we are striving for are just the bait to get us to chase after them in order to make us evolve, and it is
   the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us and those around us.
   It is natural that it should be this way—i.e., that our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals, but rather by
   striving for them—because of the law of diminishing returns.20 For example, suppose making a lot of money is
   your goal and suppose you make enough so that making more has no marginal utility. Then it would be foolish to
   continue to have making money be your goal. People who acquire things beyond their usefulness not only will
   derive little or no marginal gains from these acquisitions, but they also will experience negative consequences, as
   with any form of gluttony. So, because of the law of diminishing returns, it is only natural that seeking something
   new, or seeking new depths of something old, is required to bring us satisfaction.
   In other words, the sequence of 1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing
   these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary
   process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.
   I believe that pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution
   is universally rewarded, and what I call “good.” Look at all species in action: they are constantly pursuing their
   own interests and helping evolution in a symbiotic way, with most of them not even knowing that their self-serving
   behaviors are contributing to evolution. Like the hyenas attacking the wildebeest, successful people might not even
   know if or how their pursuit of self-interest helps evolution, but it typically does.21
   Self-interest and society’s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of self-interest
   that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that benefit them and that contribute to
   society. In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants. That is why how much money people have
   earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted—NOT how much they desired to make
   money. Look at what caused people to make a lot of money and you will see that usually it is in proportion to
   their production of what the society wanted and largely unrelated to their desire to make money. There are many
   

   people who have made a lot of money who never made making a lot of money their primary goal. Instead, they
   simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it.22 And
   there are many people who really wanted to make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted
   and they didn’t make a lot of money. In other words, there is an excellent correlation between giving society what
   it wants and making money, and almost no correlation between the desire to make money and how much money
   one makes. I know that this is true for me—i.e., I never worked to make a lot of money, and if I had I would have
   stopped ages ago because of the law of diminishing returns. I know that the same is true for all the successful,
   healthy (i.e., non-obsessed) people I know.23
   This process of productive adaptation—i.e., the process of seeking, obtaining, and pursuing new goals—does not
   just pertain to how individuals and society move forward. It is equally relevant when dealing with setbacks,
   which are inevitable. That is why many people who have had setbacks that seemed devastating at the time ended
   up as happy as (or even happier than) they were before, once they successfully adapted to them. The faster that
   one appropriately adapts, the better. As Darwin described, adaptation—i.e., adjusting appropriately to changes in
   one’s circumstances—is a big part of the evolutionary process, and it is rewarded.24 That is why some of the most
   successful people are typically those who see the changing landscape and identify how to best adapt to it.25
   So, it seems to me that desires to evolve are universal and so are symbiotic relationships that lead to the evolution
   of the whole via the pursuit of individuals’ self-interests. However, what differentiates man from other species is
   man’s greater ability to learn. Because we can learn, we can evolve more and faster than other species.
   I also believe that all things in nature have innate attributes that are both good and bad, with their goodness and
   their badness depending on what they are used for. For example, the thorns on a rose bush, the stinger on a bee,
   the aggressiveness of a lion, the timidity of a gazelle are all both good and bad, depending on their applications.
   Over time, nature evolves toward the right balance through the process of natural selection—e.g., an overly
   aggressive animal will die prematurely, as will an overly timid animal. However, because man has the ability to
   look at himself and direct his own change, individuals have the capacity to evolve.
   Most of us are born with attributes that both help us and hurt us, depending on their applications, and the more
   extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good and bad outcomes these attributes are likely to
   produce. For example, highly creative, goal-oriented people who are good at imagining the big picture often can
   easily get tripped up on the details of daily life, while highly pragmatic, task-oriented people who are great with
   the details might not be creative. That is because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see
   both ways of thinking. In nature everything was made for a purpose, and so too were these different ways of
   thinking. They just have different purposes. It is extremely important to one’s happiness and success to know
   oneself—most importantly to understand one’s own values and abilities—and then to find the right fits. We all
   have things that we value that we want and we all have strengths and weaknesses that affect our paths for
   getting them. The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people
   is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.
   Unlike any other species, man is capable of reflecting on himself and the things around him to learn and adapt in
   order to improve. He has this capability because, in the evolution of the species, man’s brain developed a part
   that no other species has—the prefrontal cortex. It is the part of the human brain that gives us the ability to
   reflect and conduct other cognitive thinking. Because of this, people who can objectively reflect on themselves
   and others—most importantly on what their weaknesses are—can figure out how to get around these weaknesses,
   can evolve fastest, and can come closer to realizing their potentials than those who can’t.
   However, typically defensive, emotional reactions—i.e., ego barriers—stand in the way of this progress. These
   reactions take place in the part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result of these reactions, most people don’t
   like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward preventing the
   
   problems they cause. Most people especially dislike others exploring their weaknesses because it makes them feel
   attacked, which produces fight or flight reactions; however, having others help one find one’s weaknesses is
   essential because it’s very difficult to identify one’s own. Most people don’t like helping others explore their
   weaknesses, even though they are willing to talk about them behind their backs. For these reasons, most people
   don’t do a good job of understanding themselves and adapting in order to get what they want most out of life. In
   my opinion, that is the biggest single problem of mankind because it, more than anything else, impedes people’s
   abilities to address all other problems and it is probably the greatest source of pain for most people.
   Some people get over the ego barrier and others don’t. Which path they choose, more than anything else, determines
   how good their outcomes are. Aristotle defined tragedy as a bad outcome for a person because of a fatal flaw that he
   can’t get around. So it is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them to experience bad outcomes.
   The Personal Evolutionary Process
   As I mentioned before, I believe that life consists of an enormous number of choices that come at us and that each
   decision we make has consequences, so the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make.
   We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions; we learn it.26 We all start off as children with others,
   typically parents, directing us. But, as we get older, we increasingly make our own choices. We choose what we
   are going after (i.e., our goals), which influences our directions. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you go to
   med school; if you want to have a family, you find a mate; and so on. As we move toward our goals, we encounter
   problems, make mistakes, and run into personal weaknesses. Above all else, how we choose to approach these
   impediments determines how fast we move toward our goals.
   I believe that the way we make our dreams into reality is by constantly engaging with reality in pursuit of our
   dreams and by using these encounters to learn more about reality itself and how to interact with it in order to get
   what we want—and that if we do this with determination, we almost certainly will be successful. In short:
   Reality
+
Dreams
+
Determination
=
A Successful Life
So what is success? I believe that it is nothing more than getting what you want—and that it is up to you to decide
what that is for you. I don’t care whether it’s being a master of the universe, a couch potato, or anything else—I
really don’t. What is essential is that you are clear about what you want and that you figure out how to get it.
However, there are a few common things that most people want.
As I mentioned, for most people success is evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning about oneself and one’s
environment and then changing to improve. Personally, I believe that personal evolution is both the greatest
accomplishment and the greatest reward.
Also, for most people happiness is much more determined by how things turn out relative to their expectations
rather than the absolute level of their conditions. For example, if a billionaire loses $200 million he will probably
be unhappy, while if someone who is worth $10,000 unexpectedly gets another $2,000, he will probably be

happy. This basic principle suggests that you can follow one of two paths to happiness: 1) have high expectations
and strive to exceed them, or 2) lower your expectations so that they are at or below your conditions. Most of us
choose the first path, which means that to be happy we have to keep evolving.
Another principle to keep in mind is that people need meaningful work and meaningful relationships in order to
be fulfilled.27 I have observed this to be true for virtually everyone, and I know that it’s true for me.28
Regardless of others’ principles, you will need to decide for yourself what you want and go after it in the best way
for you.
Your Most Important Choices
As I mentioned, as we head toward our goals we encounter an enormous number of choices that come at us, and
each decision we make has consequences. So, the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions
we make. We literally make millions of decisions that add up to the consequences that are our lives.
Of these millions, I believe that there are five big types of choices that we continually must make that radically
affect the quality of our lives and the rates at which we move toward what we want. Choosing well is not
dependent on our innate abilities such as intelligence or creativity, but more on what I think of as character. For
this reason, I believe that most people can make the right choices.
The following five decision trees show these choices. I believe that those who don’t move effectively to their
goals do the things on the top branches, and those who do move to them most quickly do the things on the
bottom branches.
First:
It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in order to
gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way.
Nature gave us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we have exceeded, our
limits in some way. At the same time, nature made the process of getting stronger require us to push our limits.
Gaining strength is the adaptation process of the body and the mind to encountering one’s limits, which is
painful. In other words, both pain and strength typically result from encountering one’s barriers. When we
encounter pain, we are at an important juncture in our decision-making process.


Most people react to pain badly. They have “fight or flight” reactions to it: they either strike out at whatever
brought them the pain or they try to run away from it. As a result, they don’t learn to find ways around their
barriers, so they encounter them over and over again and make little or no progress toward what they want.29
Those who react well to pain that stands in the way of getting to their goals—those who understand what is
causing it and how to deal with it so that it can be disposed of as a barrier—gain strength and satisfaction. This is
because most learning comes from making mistakes, reflecting on the causes of the mistakes, and learning what
to do differently in the future. Believe it or not, you are lucky to feel the pain if you approach it correctly, because
it will signal that you need to find solutions and to progress. Since the only way you are going to find solutions to
painful problems is by thinking deeply about them—i.e., reflecting30—if you can develop a knee-jerk reaction to
pain that is to reflect rather than to fight or flee, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving.31
So, please remember that:
Pain + Reflection = Progress
How big of an impediment is psychological pain to your progress?
Second:
People who confuse what they wish were true with what is really true create distorted pictures of reality that
make it impossible for them to make the best choices. They typically do this because facing “harsh realities” can
be very difficult. However, by not facing these harsh realities, they don’t find ways of properly dealing with them.
And because their decisions are not based in reality, they can’t anticipate the consequences of their decisions.32
In contrast, people who know that understanding what is real is the first step toward optimally dealing
with it make better decisions.

So, remember…
Ask yourself, “Is it true?”
…because knowing what is true is good.
How much do you let what you wish to be true
stand in the way of seeing what is really true?
Third:
People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don’t know and hide their weaknesses, so
they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the
future.33 These people typically try to prove that they have the answers, even when they really don’t. Why do
they behave in this unproductive way? They typically believe the senseless but common view that great people
are those who have the answers in their heads and don’t have weaknesses. Not only does this view not square
with reality, but it also stands in the way of progress.
I have never met a great person who did not earn and learn their greatness.34 They have weaknesses like everyone
else—they have just learned how to deal with them so that they aren’t impediments to getting what they want. In
addition, the amounts of knowledge and the capabilities that anyone does not have, and that could be used to
make the best possible decisions, are vastly greater than that which anyone (no matter how great) could have
within them.35
This explains why people who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are confident
that they have the best possible answers. So they seek to learn more (often by exploring the thinking of other
believable people, especially those who disagree with them) and they are eager to identify their weaknesses so
that they don’t let these weaknesses stand in the way of them achieving their goals.
So, what are your biggest weaknesses? Think honestly about them because if you can identify them, you are on
the first step toward accelerating your movement forward. So think about them, write them down, and look at
them frequently.

One of my biggest weaknesses is my poor rote memory: I have trouble remembering things that don’t have
reasons for being what they are, such as names, phone numbers, spellings, and addresses. Also, I am terrible at
doing tasks that require little or no logic, especially if I have to do them repeatedly. On the other hand, I have a
great contextual memory and good logic, and I can devote myself to things that interest me for untold hours. I
don’t know how much of what I am bad at is just the other side of what I am good at—i.e., how much of what I
am good at is due to my brain working in a certain way that, when applied to certain tasks, does well and when
applied to others does poorly—and how much of what I am good at was developed in order to help compensate
for what I am bad at. But I do know that I have created compensating approaches so that what I am bad at
doesn’t hurt me much; e.g., I surround myself with people who have good rote memories who do the things that I
am bad at, and I carry around tools like my BlackBerry.
How much do you worry about looking
good relative to actually being good?
Fourth:
People who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects that the
second- and subsequent-order consequences will have on their goals rarely reach their goals.36 This is
because first-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order consequences, resulting in
big mistakes in decision-making. For example, the first-order consequences of exercise (pain and time-sink) are
commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences (better health and more attractive
appearance) are desirable. Similarly, food that tastes good is often bad for you and vice versa, etc. If your goal is
to get physically fit and you don’t ignore the first-order consequences of exercise and good-tasting but unhealthy
food and connect your decisions with their second- and third-order consequences, you will not reach your goal.
Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and sometimes
they are barriers that stand in our way of getting what we want. It’s almost as though the natural selection
process sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing the dummies
who make their decisions just on the basis of the first-order consequences alone.
By contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that
drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.

are too many unknown variables to make a sound decision. For more on the probabilities of personal decision-making, please refer to the “To Make Decisions Effectively” section at the end of Part 3.

How much do you respond to 1st order consequences at
the expense of 2nd and 3rd order consequences?
Fifth:
People who blame bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than themselves are behaving in a way that is at
variance with reality and subversive to their progress.
Blaming bad outcomes on anyone or anything other than one’s self is essentially wishing that reality is different
than it is, which is silly.37 And it is subversive because it diverts one’s attention away from mustering up the
personal strength and other qualities that are required to produce the best possible outcomes.
Successful people understand that bad things come at everyone and that it is their responsibility to make
their lives what they want them to be by successfully dealing with whatever challenges they face.38
Successful people know that nature is testing them, and that it is not sympathetic.39
How much do you let yourself off the hook rather than
hold yourself accountable for your success?
In summary, I believe that you can probably get what you want out of life if you can suspend your ego
and take a no-excuses approach to achieving your goals with open-mindedness, determination, and
courage, especially if you rely on the help of people who are strong in areas that you are weak.
If I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character. Character is the
ability to get one’s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. In other words, I believe that for
the most part, achieving success—whatever that is for you—is mostly a matter of personal choice and that,
initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature that pushing your
boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you
operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of
performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of “pain,” you will

naturally evolve at an accelerating pace. Because I believe this, I believe that whether or not I achieve my goals is
a test of what I am made of. It is a game that I play, but this game is for real. In the next part, I explain how I go
about playing it.
In summary, I don’t believe that limited abilities are an insurmountable barrier to achieving your goals, if
you do the other things right.
As always, it is up to you to ask yourself if what I am saying is true. As the next part delves into this concept
more, you might want to reserve your judgment until after you have read it.
Your Two Yous and Your Machine
Those who are the most successful are capable of “higher level thinking”—i.e., they are able to step back and
design a “machine” consisting of the right people doing the right things to get what they want. They are able to
assess and improve how their “machine” works by comparing the outcomes that the machine is producing with
their goals. Schematically, the process is as shown in the diagram below. It is a feedback loop.
That schematic is meant to convey that your goals will determine the “machine” that you create to achieve them;
that machine will produce outcomes that you should compare with your goals to judge how your machine is
working. Your “machine” will consist of the design and people you choose to achieve the goals. For example, if
you want to take a hill from an enemy you will need to figure out how to do that—e.g., your design might need
two scouts, two snipers, four infantrymen, one person to deliver the food, etc. While having the right design is
essential, it is only half the battle. It is equally important to put the right people in each of these positions. They
need different qualities to play their positions well—e.g., the scouts must be fast runners, the snipers must be
precise shots, etc. If your outcomes are inconsistent with your goals (e.g., if you are having problems), you need to
modify your “machine,” which means that you either have to modify your design/culture or modify your people.
Do this often and well and your improvement process will look like the one on the left and do it poorly and it will
look like the one on the right, or worse:

I call it “higher level thinking” because your perspective is that of one who is looking down at your
machine and yourself objectively, using the feedback loop as I previously described. In other words, your most
important role is to step back and design, operate, and improve your “machine” to get what you want.
Think of it as though there are two yous—you as the designer and overseer of the plan to achieve your goals (let’s
call that one you (1)) and you as one of the participants in pursuing that mission (which we will call you (2)). You
(2) is a resource that you (1) have to get what you (1) want, but by no means your only resource. To be successful
you(1) have to be objective about you (2).
Let’s imagine that your goal is to have a winning basketball team. Wouldn’t it be silly to put yourself in a position
that you don’t play well? If you did, you wouldn’t get what you want. Whatever your goals are, achieving them
works the same way.
If you (1) see that you (2) are not capable of doing something, it is only sensible for you (1) to have someone else
do it. In other words, you (1) should look down at you (2) and all the other resources at your (1) disposal and
create a “machine” to achieve your (1) goals, remembering that you (1) don’t necessarily need to do anything
other than to design and manage the machine to get what you (1) want. If you (1) find that you (2) can’t do
something well, fire yourself (2) and get a good replacement! You shouldn’t be upset that you found out that
you(2) are bad at that—you (1) should be happy because you (1) have improved your (1) chances of getting what
you (1) want. If you (1) are disappointed because you (2) can’t be the best person to do everything, you (1) are
terribly naïve because nobody can do everything well.
The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively. If they could just get
around this, they could live up to their potential.

How much do you intellectually agree with what I just said?
How good are you in approaching life as a “higher level
thinker” rather than as a doer?
How much would you like to get better at this?
How much do you think that reading this is a waste of time?
My 5-Step Process to Getting What You40 Want Out of Life
There are five things that you have to do to get what you want out of life. First, you have to choose your goals,
which will determine your direction. Then you have to design a plan to achieve your goals. On the way to your
goals, you will encounter problems. As I mentioned, these problems typically cause pain. The most common
source of pain is in exploring your mistakes and weaknesses. You will either react badly to the pain or react like a
master problem solver. That is your choice. To figure out how to get around these problems you must be calm and
analytical to accurately diagnose your problems. Only after you have an accurate diagnosis of them can you
design a plan that will get you around your problems. Then you have to do the tasks specified in the plan.
Through this process of encountering problems and figuring out how to get around them, you will become
progressively more capable and achieve your goals more easily. Then you will set bigger, more challenging goals,
in the same way that someone who works with weights naturally increases the poundage. This is the process of
personal evolution, which I call my 5-Step Process.
In other words, “The Process” consists of five distinct steps:
Have clear goals.
Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals.
Accurately diagnose these problems.
Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to your goals.
Implement these plans—i.e., do these tasks.
You need to do all of these steps well in order to be successful.
Before discussing these individual steps in more detail, I want to make a few general points about the process.
1) You must approach these as distinct steps rather than blur them together. For example, when
   setting goals, just set goals (don’t think how you will achieve them or the other steps); when
   diagnosing problems, just diagnose problems (don’t think about how you will solve them or the other
   steps). Blurring the steps leads to suboptimal outcomes because it creates confusion and short-changes
   the individual steps. Doing each step thoroughly will provide information that will help you do the
   other steps well, since the process is iterative.
2) Each of these five steps requires different talents and disciplines. Most probably, you have lots of
   some of these and inadequate amounts of others. If you are missing any of the required talents and
   disciplines, that is not an insurmountable problem because you can acquire them, supplement them,
   or compensate for not having them, if you recognize your weaknesses and design around them. So
   you must be honestly self-reflective.
3) It is essential to approach this process in a very clear-headed, rational way rather than
   emotionally. Figure out what techniques work best for you; e.g., if emotions are getting the better of you,
   take a timeout until you can reflect unemotionally, seek the guidance of calm, thoughtful others, etc.
   

   To help you do these things well—and stay centered and effective rather than stressed and thrown off by your
   emotions—try this technique for reducing the pressure: treat your life like a game or a martial art. Your
   mission is to figure out how to get around your challenges to get to your goals. In the process of playing the game
   or practicing this martial art, you will become more skilled. As you get better, you will progress to ever-higher
   levels of the game that will require—and teach you—greater skills. I will explain what these skills are in the next
   section. However, the big and really great news is that you don’t need to have all of these skills to succeed!
   You just have to 1) know they are needed; 2) know you don’t have some of them; and 3) figure out how to get
   them (i.e., either learn them or work with others who have them).
   This particular game—i.e., your life—will challenge you in ways that will be uncomfortable at times. But if you
   work through this discomfort and reflect on it in order to learn, you will significantly improve your chances of
   getting what you want out of life. By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn’t give a
   damn what you “like.” So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what you want with what
   you need to do to get it, and then to do those things—which often are difficult but produce good results—
   so that you’ll then deserve to get what you want.
   That’s just the way it is, so you might as well accept it. Once you accept that playing the game will be uncomfortable,
   and you do it for a while, it will become much easier (like it does when getting fit). When you excel at it, you will
   find your ability to get what you want thrilling. You’ll see that excuses like “That’s not easy” are of no value and that
   it pays to “push through it” at a pace you can handle. Like getting physically fit, the most important thing is that
   you keep moving forward at whatever pace you choose, recognizing the consequences of your actions. When you
   think that it’s too hard, remember that in the long run, doing the things that will make you successful is a lot easier
   than being unsuccessful. The first-order consequences of escaping life’s challenges may seem pleasurable in the
   moment, but the second- and third-order consequences of this approach are your life and, over time, will be painful.
   With practice, you will eventually play this game like a ninja, with skill and a calm centeredness in the face of
   adversity that will let you handle most of your numerous challenges well.
   However, you will never handle them all well: mistakes are inevitable, and it’s important to recognize and accept
   this fact of life. The good news, as I have mentioned, is that most learning comes through making mistakes—so
   there is no end to learning how to play the game better. You will have an enormous number of decisions to make,
   so no matter how many mistakes you make, there will be plenty of opportunities to build a track record of success.
   That’s basically the whole concept.
   Let’s pause and reflect on this before moving on.
   Does what I am saying make sense to you?
   Do you agree that it is true?
   If not, why not?
   If you can’t work through your doubts alone, speak to me or to others about it, but PLEASE do not proceed until
   you agree with the basic logic behind the 5-Step Process. Either you will get comfortable with it and internalize
   it or you will point out something that is wrong and the process will get better.

   What follows now is a closer examination of each of the five steps.
   The 5 Steps Close-Up
1) Setting Goals
   You can have virtually anything you want, but you can’t have everything you want.
   The first, most important, and typically most difficult step in the 5-Step Process is setting goals, because it forces
   you to decide what you really want and therefore what you can possibly get out of life. This is the step where you
   face the fundamental limit: life is like a giant smorgasbord of more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope
   to taste. So you have to reject having some things you want in order to get other things you want more.
   Some people fail at this point, afraid to reject a good alternative for fear that the loss will deprive them of some
   essential ingredient to their personal happiness. As a result, they pursue too many goals at the same time,
   achieving few or none of them.
   So it’s important to remember: it doesn’t really matter if some things are unavailable to you, because the selection
   of what IS available is so great. (That is why many people who had major losses—e.g., who lost their ability to
   walk, to see, etc.—and who didn’t narrow-mindedly obsess about their loss but rather open-mindedly accepted
   and enjoyed what remained, had equally happy lives as those who didn’t ever have these losses.)
   In other words, you can have an enormous amount: much, much more than what you need to have for a happy
   life. So don’t get discouraged by not being able to have everything you want, and for God’s sake, don’t be
   paralyzed by the choices. That’s nonsensical and unproductive. Get on with making your choices.
   Put another way, to achieve your goals you have to prioritize, and that includes rejecting good alternatives
   (so that you have the time and resources to pursue even better ones—time being probably your greatest limiting
   factor, though, through leverage, you can substantially reduce time’s constraints).
   It is important not to confuse “goals” and “desires.”
   Goals are the things that you really want to achieve, while desires are things you want that can prevent you from
   reaching your goals—as I previously explained, desires are typically first-order consequences. For example, a goal
   might be physical fitness, while a desire is the urge to eat good-tasting, unhealthy food (i.e., a first-order
   consequence) that could undermine you obtaining your fitness goal. So, in terms of the consequences they
   produce, goals are good and desires are bad.41
   Don’t get me wrong. I believe you can choose to pursue any goal you want as long as you consider the consequences.
   So, staying with this example, I think it is perfectly OK for you to make your goal to enjoy eating good-tasting,
   unhealthy food if that choice will bring you what you really want. As I said earlier, if you want to be a couch potato,
   that’s fine with me—seriously. But if that’s not what you want, you better not open that bag of chips. In other words,
   failing to make the distinction between goals and desires will lead you in the wrong direction, because you will be
   inclined to pursue things you want that will undermine your ability to get things you want more. In short, you can
   pursue anything you desire—just make sure that you know the consequences of what you are doing.
   Another common reason people fail at this stage is that they lose sight of their goals, getting caught up in
   day-to-day tasks.
   Avoid setting goals based on what you think you can achieve.
   As I said before, do each step separately and distinctly without regard to the others. In this case, that means
   don’t rule out a goal due to a superficial assessment of its attainability. Once you commit to a goal, it might take
   lots of thinking and many revisions to your plan over a considerable time period in order to finalize the design
   
   “bad”, but I do think that desires that fundamentally divert you from your goals should be avoided at all cost.

   and do the tasks to achieve it. So you need to set goals without yet assessing whether or not you can achieve them.
   This requires some faith that you really can achieve virtually anything,42 even if you don’t know how you will do
   it at that moment. Initially you have to have faith that this is true, but after following this process and succeeding
   at achieving your goals, you will gain confidence. If you like, you can start with more modest goals and, when you
   build up the track record to give you faith, increase your aspirations.
   Every time I set goals, I don’t yet have any idea how I am going to achieve them because I haven’t yet gone through the
   process of thinking through them. But I have learned that I can achieve them if I think creatively and work hard.43
   I also know that I can “cheat.” Unlike in school, in life you don’t have to come up with all the right answers. You
   can ask the people around you for help—or even ask them to do the things you don’t do well.
   In other words, there is almost no reason you can’t succeed if you take the attitude of 1) total flexibility—good
   answers can come from anyone or anywhere (and in fact, as I have mentioned, there are far more good answers
   “out there” than there are in you) and 2) total accountability: regardless of where the good answers come from,
   it’s your job to find them.
   This no-excuses approach helps me do whatever it takes to get whatever I want most. Not all goals are achievable,
   of course. There are some impossibilities or near-impossibilities, such as living forever, or flying with just the power
   of your arms. But it’s been my experience that if I commit to bringing creativity, flexibility, and determination to the
   pursuit of my goals, I will figure out some way to get them, i.e., almost all goals are attainable. And as I don’t limit
   my goals to what seems attainable at the moment I set them, the goals I set tend to be higher than they would
   otherwise be. Since trying to achieve high goals makes me stronger, I become increasingly capable of achieving
   more. Great expectations create great capabilities, in other words. And if I fail to achieve my goal, it just tells me
   that I have not been creative or flexible or determined enough to do what it takes, and I circle back and figure out
   what I need to do about this situation.
   Achieving your goals isn’t just about moving forward.
   Inevitably, you must deal with setbacks. So goals aren’t just those things that you want and don’t have. They
   might also be keeping what you do have, minimizing your rate of loss, or dealing with irrevocable loss. Life will
   throw you challenges, some of which will seem devastating at the time. Your goal is always to make the best
   possible choices, knowing that you will be rewarded if you do. It’s like playing golf: sometimes you will be in the
   fairway and sometimes you will be in the rough, so you have to know how to play it as it lies.
   Generally speaking, goal setting is best done by those who are good at big-picture conceptual thinking, synthesizing,
   visualizing, and prioritizing. But whatever your strengths and weaknesses are, don’t forget the big and really great
   news here: it is not essential that you have all of these qualities yourself, because you can supplement them with the
   help of others.
   In summary, in order to get what you want, the first step is to really know what you want, without confusing goals with
   desires, and without limiting yourself because of some imagined impediments that you haven’t thoroughly analyzed.
   
   doing the other four steps (especially designing) you will thoroughly think through what is possible. Then you will circle back and enter the goal-setting mode again. As I mentioned, this five-step process is iterative, but it
   must be pursued one step at a time in order to do each step excellently.
   

   How well do you know what you want most out of life?
   What are your most important goals?
   Are you good at setting your goals?
   How confident are you that your assessment
   of your ability to set goals is right?
   If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should
   you be confident (e.g., because you have a demonstrated
   track record, because many believable people have told you, etc.)?
2) Identifying and Not Tolerating Problems
   After you set your goals, you must come up with a plan or a design to achieve them and then you must execute that
   plan by doing the tasks. On the way to achieving your goals and executing your design, you will encounter problems
   that have to be diagnosed, so that the design can be modified to get around these obstacles. That’s why you need to
   identify and not tolerate problems.
   Most problems are potential improvements screaming at you.
   Whenever a problem surfaces, you have in front of you an opportunity to improve. The more painful the problem, the
   louder it is screaming.44 In order to be successful, you have to 1) perceive problems and 2) not tolerate them.
   If you don’t identify your problems, you won’t solve them, so you won’t move forward toward achieving your goals.
   As a result, it is essential to bring problems to the surface.
   Most people don’t like to do this. But most successful people know that they have to do this.
   The most common reasons people don’t successfully identify their problems are generally rooted either in a lack of
   will or in a lack of talent or skill:
   • Problems can be “harsh realities” that are unpleasant to look at, so people often subconsciously put them
   “out of sight” so they will be “out of mind.”
   • Thinking about problems that are difficult to solve can produce anxiety that stands in the way of progress.
   • People often worry more about appearing to not have problems than about achieving their desired
   results, and therefore avoid recognizing that their own mistakes and/or weaknesses are causing the
   problems. This aversion to seeing one’s own mistakes and weaknesses typically occurs because they’re
   viewed as deficiencies you’re stuck with rather than as essential parts of the personal evolution process.
   • Sometimes people are simply not perceptive enough to see the problems.
   • Some people are unable to distinguish big problems from small ones. Since nothing is perfect, it is
   possible to identify an infinite number of problems everywhere. If you are unable to distinguish the big
   problems from the little ones, you can’t “successfully” (i.e., in a practical way) identify problems.
   Remember, you don’t have to be good at any of the five steps (in this case, identifying problems) to be successful
   if you get help from others. So push through the pain of facing your problems, knowing you will end up in a
   much better place.
   
   because you almost always find a better way of dealing with them than if you don’t face them head on. The more difficult the problem, the more important it is that you stare at it and deal with it. After seeing how
   effectively facing reality–especially your problems, mistakes and weaknesses–works, you will become comfortable with it and won’t want to operate any other way. I also believe that one of the best ways of getting at
   truth is reflecting with others who have opposing views and who share your interest in finding the truth rather than being proven right.

   When identifying problems, it is important to remain centered and logical.
   While it can be tempting to react emotionally to problems and seek sympathy or blame others, this accomplishes
   nothing.45 Whatever the reasons, you have to get over the impediments to succeed. Remember that the pains you
   are feeling are “growing pains” that will test your character and reward you if you push through them. Try to look
   at your problems as a detached observer would. Remember that identifying problems is like finding gems
   embedded in puzzles: if you solve the puzzles you will get the gems that will make your life much better.
   Doing this continuously will lead to your rapid evolution. So, if you’re logical, you really should get excited about
   finding problems because identifying them will bring you closer to your goals.
   How good are you at perceiving problems?
   How confident are you that your assessment of
   your ability to perceive problems is right?
   If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be
   confident (e.g., because you have a demonstrated track record,
   because many believable people have told you, etc.)?
   Be very precise in specifying your problems.
   It is essential to identify your problems with precision, for different problems have different solutions. For
   example, if your impediments are due largely to issues of will—to your unwillingness to confront what is really
   happening—you have to strengthen your will, for example, by starting small and building up your confidence.
   If your problems are related to lack of skill or innate talent, the most powerful antidote is to have others point
   things out to you and objectively consider whether what they identify is true. Problems due to inadequate skill
   might then be solved with training, whereas those arising from innate weaknesses might be overcome with
   assistance or role changes. It doesn’t matter which is the case, it only matters that the true cause is identified and
   appropriately addressed.46
   The more precise you are, the easier it will be to come up with accurate diagnoses and successful solutions. For
   example, rather than saying something like “People don’t like me,” it is better to specify which people don’t like
   you and under what circumstances.
   Don’t confuse problems with causes.
   “I can’t get enough sleep” is not a problem, it is a cause of some problem. What exactly is that problem? To avoid
   confusing the problem with its causes, try to identify the suboptimal outcome, e.g., “I am performing badly in my
   job because I am tired.”
   Once you identify your problems, you must not tolerate them.
   Tolerating problems has the same result as not identifying them (i.e., both stand in the way of getting past the
   problem), but the root causes are different. Tolerating problems might be due to not thinking that they can be
   solved, or not caring enough about solving them.47 People who tolerate problems are the worse off because,
   without the motivation to move on, they cannot succeed. In other words, if you are motivated, you can succeed
   even if you don’t have the abilities (i.e., talents and skills) because you can get the help from others. But if you’re
   not motivated to succeed, if you don’t have the will to succeed, the situation is hopeless.
   
   or punished.

   How much do you tolerate problems?
   How confident are you that your assessment of
   how much you tolerate problems is right?
   If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be
   confident (e.g., because you have a demonstrated track record,
   because many believable people have told you, etc.)?
   People who are good at this step—identifying and not tolerating problems—tend to have strong abilities to perceive
   and synthesize a clear and accurate picture, as well as demonstrate a fierce intolerance of badness (regardless of
   the severity).
   Remember that you need to do each step independently from the other steps before moving on.
   Can you comfortably identify your problems without thinking about how to solve them? It is a good exercise to just
   make a list of them, without possible solutions. Only after you have created a clear picture of your problems should
   you go to the next step.
   For a more detailed explanation of identifying and not tolerating problems, please read my management principles.
3) Diagnosing the Problems
   You will be much more effective if you focus on diagnosis and design rather than jumping to solutions.
   It is a very common mistake for people to move directly from identifying a tough problem to a proposed solution in
   a nanosecond without spending the hours required to properly diagnose and design a solution. This typically yields
   bad decisions that don’t alleviate the problem. Diagnosing and designing are what spark strategic thinking.
   You must be calm and logical.
   When diagnosing problems, as when identifying problems, reacting emotionally, though sometimes difficult to
   avoid, can undermine your effectiveness as a decision-maker. By contrast, staying rational will serve you well. So if
   you are finding yourself shaken by your problems, do what you can to get yourself centered before moving forward.
   You must get at the root causes.
   Root causes, like principles, are things that manifest themselves over and over again as the deep-seated reasons
   behind the actions that cause problems. So you will get many everlasting dividends if you can find them and
   properly deal with them.
   It is important to distinguish root causes from proximate causes. Proximate causes typically are the actions or lack
   of actions that lead to problems—e.g., “I missed the train because I didn’t check the train schedule.” Proximate
   causes are typically described via verbs. Root causes are the deeper reasons behind the proximate cause—e.g.,
   “I didn’t check the schedule because I am forgetful.” Root causes are typically described with adjectives, usually
   characteristics about what the person is like that lead them to an action or an inaction.
   Identifying the real root causes of your problems is essential because you can eliminate your problems only by
   removing their root causes. In other words, you must understand, accept, and successfully deal with reality in order
   to move toward your goals.

   Recognizing and learning from one’s mistakes and the mistakes of others who affect outcomes is critical to
   eliminating problems.
   Many problems are caused by people’s mistakes. But people often find it difficult to identify and accept their own
   mistakes. Sometimes it’s because they’re blind to them, but more often it’s because ego and shortsightedness
   make discovering their mistakes and weaknesses painful. Because people are often upset when their mistakes are
   pointed out to them, most people are reluctant to point out mistakes in others. As a result, an objective diagnosis
   of problems arising from people’s mistakes is often missing and personal evolution is stunted. (As I mentioned in
   the last chapter, most learning comes from making mistakes and experiencing the pain of them—e.g., putting your
   hand on a hot stove—and adapting.) It is at this stage that most people fail to progress. More than anything else,
   what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don’t is a willingness to look at
   themselves and others objectively.
   I call the pain that comes from looking at yourself and others objectively “growing pains,” because it is the pain that
   accompanies personal growth. No pain, no gain. Of course, anyone who really understands that no one is perfect and
   that these discoveries are essential for personal growth finds that these discoveries elicit “growing pleasures.” But it
   seems to be in our nature to overly focus on short-term gratification rather than long-term satisfaction—on first-order
   rather than second- or third-order consequences—so the connection between this behavior and the rewards it brings
   doesn’t come naturally. However, if you can make this connection, such moments will begin to elicit pleasure rather
   than pain. It is similar to how exercise eventually becomes pleasurable for people who hardwire the connection
   between exercise and its benefits.
   Remember that:
   Pain + Reflection = Progress
   Much as you might wish this were not so, this is a reality that you should just accept and deal with. There is no get�ting around the fact that achieving success requires getting at the root causes of all important problems, and people’s
   mistakes and weaknesses are sometimes the root causes. So to be successful, you must be willing to look at your
   own behavior and the behavior of others as possible causes of problems.
   Of course, some problems aren’t caused by people making mistakes. For example, if lightning strikes, it causes
   problems that have nothing to do with human error. All problems need to be well-diagnosed before you decide what
   to do about them.
   The most important qualities for successfully diagnosing problems are logic, the ability to see multiple possibilities,
   and the willingness to touch people’s nerves to overcome the ego barriers that stand in the way of truth.
   For a more detailed explanation of diagnosing problems, please read my management principles.
   In diagnosing problems, how willing are you to “touch the nerve”
   (i.e., discuss your and others possible mistakes and weaknesses with them)?
   Are you willing to get at root causes, like what people are like?
   Are you good at seeing the patterns and synthesizing
   them into diagnoses of root causes?
   How confident are you that your assessment
   of your ability to diagnose is accurate?
   If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you
   be confident (e.g., because you have a demonstrated
   track record, because many believable people have told you, etc.)?

4) Designing the Plan (Determining the Solutions)
   In some cases, you might go from setting goals to designing the plans that will get you to these goals; while in other
   cases, you will encounter problems on the way to your goals and have to design your way around them. So design
   will occur at both stages of the process, though it will occur much more often in figuring out how to get around
   problems. In other words, most of the movement toward your goals comes from designing how to remove the root
   causes of your problems. Problems are great because they are very specific impediments, so you know that you will
   move forward if you can identify and eliminate their root causes.
   Creating a design is like writing a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time in order
   to achieve the goal.
   Visualize the goal or problem standing in your way, and then visualize practical solutions. When designing solutions,
   the objective is to change how you do things so that problems don’t recur—or recur so often. Think about each
   problem individually and as the product of root causes—like the outcomes produced by a machine. Then think about
   how the machine should be changed to produce good outcomes rather than bad ones. There are typically many
   paths toward achieving your goals, and you need to find only one of them that works, so it’s almost always doable.
   But an effective design requires thinking things through and visualizing how things will come together and unfold
   over time. It’s essential to visualize the story of where you have been (or what you have done) that has led you to
   where you are now and what will happen sequentially in the future to lead you to your goals. You should visualize
   this plan through time, like watching a movie that connects your past, present, and future.
   Then write down the plan so you don’t lose sight of it, and include who needs to do what and when. The list of tasks
   falls out from this story (i.e., the plan), but they are not the same. The story, or plan, is what connects your goals to
   the tasks. For you to succeed, you must not lose sight of the goals or the story while focusing on the tasks; you must
   constantly refer back and forth. In My Management Principles (Part 3), you can see one such plan.
   When designing your plan, think about the timelines of various interconnected tasks. Sketch them out loosely and
   then refine them with the specific tasks. This is an iterative process, alternating between sketching out your broad
   steps (e.g., hire great people) and filling these in with more specific tasks with estimated timelines (e.g., in the next
   two weeks choose the headhunters to find the great people) that will have implications (e.g., costs, time, etc.). These
   will lead you to modify your design sketch until the design and tasks work well together. Being as specific as possible
   (e.g., specifying who will do what and when) allows you to visualize how the design will work at both a big-picture
   level and in detail. It will also give you and others the to-do lists and target dates that will help direct you.
   Of course, not all plans will accomplish everything you want in the desired time frame. In such cases, it is essential
   that you look at what won’t be accomplished and ask yourself if the consequences are acceptable or unacceptable.
   This is where perspective is required, and discussing it with others can be critical. If the plan will not achieve what’s
   necessary in the required time, so that the consequences have an unacceptably high probability of preventing you
   from achieving your goal, you have to either think harder (probably with the advice of other believable people) to
   make the plan do what is required or reduce your goals.
   It doesn’t take much time to design a good plan—literally just hours spread out over days or weeks—and whatever
   amount of time you spend designing it will be only a small fraction of the time you spend executing it. But designing
   is very important because it determines what you will have to do to be effective. Most people make the very big
   mistake of spending virtually no time on this step because they are too preoccupied with execution. This process is
   explained in detail in my management principles.
   People successful with this stage have an ability to visualize and a practical understanding of how things really work.
   Remember, you don’t have to possess all these qualities if you have someone to help you with the ones you are missing.

   How good is your ability to visualize?
   How confident are you that your assessment
   of your ability to visualize is accurate?
   If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be
   confident (e.g., do you have an excellent track record of visualizing
   and making what you visualized happen, have other believable
   parties told you that you are good at this)?
   Remember: Designing precedes doing! The design will give you your to-do list (i.e., the tasks).
5) Doing the Tasks
   Next, you and the others you need to rely on have to do the tasks that will get you to your goals. Great planners
   who don’t carry out their plans go nowhere. You need to “push through” to accomplish the goals. This requires the
   self-discipline to follow the script that is your design. I believe the importance of good work habits is vastly
   underrated. There are lots of books written about good work habits, so I won’t digress into what I believe is
   effective. However, it is critical to know each day what you need to do and have the discipline to do it. People
   with good work habits have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they make themselves do what needs to
   be done. By contrast, people with poor work habits almost randomly react to the stuff that comes at them, or they
   can’t bring themselves to do the things they need to do but don’t like to do (or are unable to do). There are lots of
   tools that can help (e.g., thank God for my BlackBerry!)
   You need to know whether you (and others) are following the plan, so you should establish clear benchmarks.
   Ideally you should have someone other than yourself objectively measure if you (and others) are doing what you
   planned. If not, you need to diagnose why and resolve the problem.
   People who are good at this stage can reliably execute a plan. They tend to be self-disciplined and proactive rather
   than reactive to the blizzard of daily tasks that can divert them from execution. They are results-oriented: they
   love to push themselves over the finish line to achieve the goal. If they see that daily tasks are taking them away
   from executing the plan (i.e., they identify this problem), they diagnose it and design how they can deal with both
   the daily tasks and moving forward with the plan.
   As with the other steps, if you aren’t good at this step, get help. There are many successful, creative people who
   are good at the other steps but who would have failed because they aren’t good at execution. But they succeeded
   nonetheless because of great symbiotic relationships with highly reliable task-doers.
   For a more detailed explanation of doing what you set out to do, please see My Management Principles.
   How good are you at pushing through?
   How confident are you that your assessment of
   your ability to push through is accurate?
   If you are confident of your self-assessment, why should you be
   confident (e.g., because you have a demonstrated track record,
   because many believable people have told you, etc.)?

   The Relationships between These Steps
   Designs and tasks have no purpose other than to achieve your goals. Said differently, goals are the sole purpose of
   designs and tasks. So you mustn’t forget how they’re related. Frequently I see people feel great about doing their
   tasks while forgetting the goals they were designed to achieve, resulting in the failure to achieve their goals. This
   doesn’t make any sense, because the only purpose of tasks is to achieve goals. In order to be successful, your goals
   must be riveted in your mind: they are the things you MUST do. To remember the connections between the tasks
   and the goals that they are meant to achieve, you just have to ask, “Why?” It is good to connect tasks to goals this
   way (with the “Why?”), because losing sight of the connections will prevent you from succeeding.
   Again, this 5-Step Process is iterative. This means that after completing one of the steps you will probably have
   acquired relevant information that leads you to modify the other steps.
   If this process is working, goals will change much more slowly than designs, which will change more slowly than
   tasks. Designs and tasks can be modified or changed often (because you might want to reassess how to achieve the
   goal), but changing goals frequently is usually a problem because achieving them requires a consistent effort. I often
   find that people who have problems reaching their goals handle these steps backwards; that is, they stick too rigidly
   to specified tasks and are not committed enough to achieving their goals (often because they lose sight of them).
   Weaknesses Don’t Matter if You Find Solutions
   To repeat, the best advice I can give you is to ask yourself what you want, then ask ‘what is true,’ and then ask
   yourself ‘what should be done about it.’ If you honestly ask and answer these questions you will move much faster
   toward what you want to get out of life than if you don’t!
   Most importantly, ask yourself what is your biggest weakness that stands in the way of what you want.
   As I mentioned before, everyone has weaknesses. The main difference between unsuccessful and successful people
   is that unsuccessful people don’t find and address them, and successful people do.
   It is difficult to see one’s own blind spots for two reasons:
1) Most people don’t go looking for their weaknesses because of “ego barriers”—they find having weaknesses
   painful because society has taught them that having weaknesses is bad. As I said early on, I believe that we
   would have a radically more effective and much happier society if we taught the truth, which is that everyone
   has weaknesses, and knowing about them and how to deal with them is how people learn and succeed.
2) Having a weakness is like missing a sense—if you can’t visualize what it is, it’s hard to perceive not having it.
   For these two reasons, having people show you what you are missing can be painful, though it’s essential for your
   progress. When you encounter that pain, try to remember that you can get what you want out of life if you can
   open-mindedly reflect, with the help of others, on what is standing in your way and then deal with it.
   What do you think is the biggest weakness you have that stands in the
   way of what you want—the one that you repeatedly run into?
   People who don’t get what they want out of life fail at one or more of the five steps. But being weak at any one of
   these steps is not a problem if you understand what you are weak at and successfully compensate for that
   weakness by seeking help. For example, a good goal-setter who is bad at doing tasks might work well with a bad
   goal-setter who is great at doing tasks—i.e., they will be much more successful working together. It is easy to find out
   what weaknesses are standing in your way by 1) identifying which steps you are failing at and 2) getting the feedback
   of people who are successful at doing what you are having problems with.

   Because I believe that you will achieve your goals if you do these five steps well, it follows that if you are not
   achieving your goals you can use the 5-Step Process as a diagnostic tool. You would do this by 1) identifying the
   step(s) that you are failing at, 2) noting the qualities required to succeed at that step, and 3) identifying which of
   these qualities you are missing.
   To repeat, the five steps and the qualities that I believe are required to be good at them are as follows.
   At which step do you have the most problems?
   Which qualities needed do you wish you had more of ?
   In a nutshell, my 5-Step process for achieving what you want is:
   Values 1) Goals 2) Problems 3) Diagnoses 4) Designs 5) Tasks
   Your values determine what you want, i.e., your goals. In trying to achieve your goals, you will encounter problems
   that have to be diagnosed. Only after determining the real root causes of these problems can you design a plan to get
   around them. Once you have a good plan, you have to muster the self-discipline to do what is required to make the plan
   succeed. Note that this process starts with your values, but it requires that you succeed at all five steps. While these
   steps require different abilities, you don’t have to be good at all of them. If you aren’t good at all of them (which is true
   for almost everyone), you need to know what you are bad at and how to compensate for your weaknesses. This requires
   you to put your ego aside, objectively reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and seek the help from others.
   As you design and implement your plan to achieve your goals, you may find it helpful to consider that:
   • Life is like a game where you seek to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving your goals.
   • You get better at this game through practice.
   • The game consists of a series of choices that have consequences.
   • You can’t stop the problems and choices from coming at you, so it’s better to learn how to deal with them.
   • You have the freedom to make whatever choices you want, though it’s best to be mindful of their consequences.

   • The pain of problems is a call to find solutions rather than a reason for unhappiness and inaction, so it’s silly,
   pointless, and harmful to be upset at the problems and choices that come at you (though it’s understandable).
   • We all evolve at different paces, and it’s up to you to decide the pace at which you want to evolve.48
   • The process goes better if you are as accurate as possible in all respects, including assessing your strengths
   and weaknesses and adapting to them.
   While all this may sound very theoretical, it is integral to how we operate every day. For example, my management
   principles, which are explained in the next section, are based on the principles that I described in this section. So,
   Bridgewater is based on the core belief that everyone here is evolving together. How well and how quickly we do
   that will have a huge effect on our well-being and the well-being of all the people we have contact with (e.g., our
   clients, our families, etc.). These two things are inextricably linked. Bridgewater is also based on the belief that to
   be successful and happy, not only do we have to be excellent, we have to continue to improve at a surprisingly fast
   rate. Bridgewater operates consistently with the belief that to be excellent and improve at a fast rate, we must be
   hyper-realistic and hyper-truthful. We therefore need to overcome any impediments to being realistic and truthful,
   and the biggest impediment is people’s reluctance to face their own mistakes and weaknesses and those of others.
   Bridgewater is based on the belief that both meaningful work and meaningful relationships are required to be
   happy and successful. So, our relationships, like our work, must be excellent; as a result, we expect people to be
   extremely considerate and caring with each other. This does not mean being soft on each other, especially if that
   means avoiding harsh realities to avoid causing discomfort. It means true caring, which requires recognizing and
   successfully dealing with our realities, whatever they are.
   The management principles that follow reflect these core values and the specific ways that they are lived out at
   Bridgewater.
